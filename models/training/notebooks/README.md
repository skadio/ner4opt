There are **two** notebooks in this folder

1. The `data_augmentation` notebook delves into how we can find infrequent patterns in entities and use such sentences for our upsampling.
2. The `entity_gazetteers` notebook delves into how we can find frequently occurring phrases in each entity type and build gazetteers on this basis.
